Wrtie a blog on the Difference between document and window objects
*The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the window. 
The window object represents the browser window.
The document object is a property of the window object. The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.
The document object has properties like the title, URL, and cookie. The document object is part of the DOM, while the window object is part of the BOM.

    *When working with JavaScript, developers often encounter two essential objects: the document object and the window object. While they may seem similar, they serve distinct roles in web development. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between the document and window objects and shed light on their unique functionalities.

-----The Window Object:
The window object is a global object in the browser's JavaScript environment. It represents the browser window or the tab in which the script is running. 

1.Global Scope:
    The window object is accessible globally. Any variable or function declared without the var, let, or const keyword becomes a property of the window object.

2.Browser Window Properties:
    The window object provides properties that describe the browser window, such as window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, window.location, etc.

3.Timers and Intervals:
    Functions like setTimeout and setInterval are methods of the window object, allowing developers to execute code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.

4.Navigation:
    The window object facilitates navigation through methods like window.open() for opening new browser windows and window.close() for closing the current window.

-----The Document Object:
On the other hand, the document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser. It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document. Here are the key characteristics of the document object:

1.DOM Manipulation:
    The document object is the entry point to the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to manipulate the structure, style, and content of the HTML document.

2.Element Selection:
    Methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector are part of the document object, facilitating the selection of HTML elements.

3.Events Handling:
    The document object handles events occurring within the document, such as user clicks, keypresses, and form submissions. Event listeners can be added to document elements to respond to these events.

4.Forms and Input Handling:
    The document object provides methods to interact with HTML forms and form elements, making it possible to retrieve user input.
Key Differences:
--Scope:
The window object is global and represents the entire browser window, while the document object is specific to the loaded HTML document.
--Functionality:
The window object deals with browser-related functionalities and global variables, while the document object is focused on DOM manipulation and document-specific interactions.
--Hierarchy:
The document object is nested within the window object. In other words, the window object contains the document object.
